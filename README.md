# IoT control

This application was created as a school project for a course in mobile app development. It is designed for the Android platform, version 7.0 and higher. The main focus of the application is receiving and sending data from the ESP8266 chip via the Internet to the Android application located on the phone. The application will be able to connect to devices in the user's home. So far, the main features are a fan control and displaying the temperature and humidity in the room. Furthermore, the application is able to plot graphs of temperature and humidity as a function of time. The application also sends notifications if the humidity in the room exceeds a healthy threshold.

The app communicates through the web server and JSON technology. User settings are stored in SharedPreferences, whereas the user can choose between light and dark modes. He can also enable or disable humidity notifications. Future extensions of the application could include light switching and automatic maintenance of a healthy level of humidity.

# IoT control

This app was developed for a mobile app development course in school, specifically for Android devices running version 7.0 and above. Its primary purpose is to facilitate communication between the Android application on the user's phone and the ESP8266 chip via the Internet. The app allows users to connect to devices within their home.

Key features include fan control, displaying room temperature and humidity, and graphing these values over time. The app employs web server and JSON technology for communication. User preferences are stored in SharedPreferences, offering options like light and dark modes. Users can also choose to receive or disable humidity notifications.

Looking ahead, potential updates may introduce features such as light control and automatic maintenance of optimal humidity levels for a healthier environment.
